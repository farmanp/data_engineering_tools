# Data Engineering Tools
A repo catalog of data engineering tools comparing with cloud, enterprise, and open source

This is meant to serve as reference for folks to try and use data engineering tools and frameworks without relying on cloud computing resources and servces. Data engineering is a challenging field to get into due to the limitations you have of working in data before getting work experience in data. My hopen is to give you the resources you need, starting with listing out the tools that you can try on your own. They are basically the same throughout!
